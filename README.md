# Would You Rather... - Udacity React Nanodegree Project

Second project for the React Nanodegree. Would You Rather is a card question game app that keeps track of the questions answered and asked by the user. After logging in, the root page displays all unanswered and answered question by the user. The user can add questions on the /add page and view the leaderboard on the /leaderboard page. All questions can be viewed and have displayed the question to be asked or the results of the answered question at the /questions/:id page. This project was testing the relationship between React and Redux. Mainly to build a central location of data in the store. The app is pulling and pushing question data through the _DATA.js api. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
